  <p> This is a short paragraph about my education history. I went to
  five different schools as a child. I received multiple scholarships 
  which made my school selection hard. St. John's offered the most so I had 
  to take it. </p>

    <p> <a name="programming"> </a> </p>
  <p> I have experience using Java in two programming classes that I took. </p>

    <p> <a name="music"> </a> </p>
  <p> It is impossible to choose a favorite song. My favorite genres are metal and classical, which are extreme opposites. I like Danse Macabre and
  Nocturne op.9. The same can be said about a movie or TV show. </p>

    <p> <a name="interests"> </a> </p>
   <p> My only interests involve spending time with my dog and looking at expensive items I want to buy. Stella is my favorite person to spend time with. </p> 
    
    
<a href="http://www.amazon.com"> This is my favorite website because you can buy
anything from home </a>
