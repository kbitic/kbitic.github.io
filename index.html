  <p> This is a short paragraph about my education history. I went to
  five different schools as a child. After finishing high school, I attended
  Oxford University briefly. I transferred to St. John's University
  because I missed seeing my grandmother daily. </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Farm hand, 2 years </li>
    <li> Electrical apprentice, 3 years </li>
    <li> Estate manager, 2 years </li>
  </ul>

  <p> I have experience using Java in two programming classes that I took. </p>

  <p> It is impossible to choose a favorite song. I like Danse Macabre and
  Nocturne op.9. The same can be said about a movie or TV show. </p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com"> This is my favorite website because you can buy
anything from home </a>
